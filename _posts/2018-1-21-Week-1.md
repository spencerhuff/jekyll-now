title: Week 1 (15 Jan - 21 Jan, 2018)
---

**1. What are your expectations of the class? (special question, first time only)**

I have heard that this class is a lot of work, but the skills learned are very useful in a real world programming job. This will come in handy during my internship this summer and for my future career in software engineering. I am expecting to learn how to use git, how to create a website from the ground up, and gain an in-depth knowledge of python.


**2. What did you do this past week?**

This week marked the start of the new semester. I am particularly excited about the two music classes I am taking this semester: Music of African Americans and Elements of Music. Music of African Americans is a class about the history of hip-hop from the 70's to the present, and Elements of Music teaches basic music theory and notation.


**3. What's in your way?**

In the past, I have had a bad habit of procrastinating, but I am trying to change that this semester by staying on track from week one.


**4. What will you do next week?**

Next week I am going to go to all of my classes, keep up with all of my schoolwork by starting it well before it is due, and spend a some time tidying up my apartment.


**5. What's my experience of the class?**

So far there have only been two classes, but I am enjoying the lecture and am looking forward to learning more about python next class. Professor Downing said that there would be a large disconnect between what we learn in class and what we will be expected to do for the project, and I am already starting to see that in making this blog. Even though it is harder to learn new technologies on your own compared to learning from someone teaching you in class, this is how the real world works. I am expecting to have to learn new languages and technologies without much direction when I enter the workforce.


**6. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

My big project this week was creating this blog!
I haven't touched web development since my 7th grade technology class, when we had to learn how to write a basic website using HTML, so you can imagine how I felt faced with the prospect of creating my own blog from scratch. Luckily there are websites, like Wordpress and GitHub Pages, that make creating a blog easy. I decided on GitHub Pages because I wanted to become more comfortable using git and GitHub. A quick Google search lead me to [this link](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), explaining how to easily set up a GitHub Pages blog using a website generator called Jekyll. And [here is a cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for using Markdown (the markup language I used for this blog).
