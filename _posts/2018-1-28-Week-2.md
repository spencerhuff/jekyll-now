title: Week 2 (22 Jan - 28 Jan, 2018)
---

**1. What did you do this past week?**

Since this week was the second of the semester, most of my classes started giving out real work. In Software Engineering I learned about JavaScript and unit testing. We learned how to read musical notes with different rhythms, time signatures, and clefs in my Elements of Music class. And in Music of African Americans, I learned about the hip-hop industry (Wiz Khalifa's 'Black and Yellow' and Talyor Swift's entire album '1989' were both ghostwritten by the same person!!)
Also, my two cats (pictured below) recently celebrated their 1st birthday!

**2. What's in your way?**

I'm trying to find an apartment for next year which took up a lot of my free time this week. I'm glad that we aren't too far into the semester, so I didn't have much schoolwork to finish.


**3. What will you do next week?**

Continue to stay on track in all of my classes, and enjoy having more free time than this past week. I also will be finishing up the collatz project for Software Engineering.


**4. What's my experience of the class?**

It has been really informative so far. Making us figure out how to use Travis-CI and git on our own makes it more challenging, but ultimately more rewarding. It took me longer than I thought it would to learn how to use Travis-CI, but now that I pretty much understand it I am realizing how useful the tool is. Writing unit tests and having them automatically build and run whenever you push to a remote repo gives you a lot of information without much extra work after the initial set up.


**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

[Here is an informative (and very in-depth) article](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) on how Travis-CI builds your repo and how to customize the .travis.yml file. The more I look into Travis-CI, the more impressed I am by how much you can do with it. I have never written official unit tests before, and I am really liking how streamlined the process is when it is automated.
