title: Week 10 (26 Mar - 01 Apr, 2018)
---

**1. What did you do this past week?**

In the last week, I spent a lot of my time on schoolwork. In Software Engineering we learned about SQL, which I also have been learning this semseter in my Data Management class with Dr. Cannata. Currently in Data Management we are working on a project to visualize and find interesting trends in a dataset of our choosing. Our group found a really interesting dataset with a lot of detailed information on Police Shootings in Seattle over the last 10 years. As part of that project we are learning to use R and Tableau, which are both great data visualization tools. In my Elements of Music class we learned about chords, which was interesting because I play the guitar and know how to play chords on it, but now I know the underlying theory about them. Outside of school I spent some good quality time with my 2 cats, and I also biked quite a bit.

**2. What's in your way?**

With the semester getting closer to ending, I need to make sure I stay focused and finish out strong.

**3. What will you do next week?**

Probably spend a lot of time working on the SWE project.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

It's really informative, I like Professor Downing's teaching style when it comes to programming. Having examples of code up on the screen and showing how changes in the code affect the output in real time is very helpful.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

As I mentioned above, [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) is a great tool for data visualization. It seems to be one of those pieces of software that is easy to learn but hard to master, so I reccommend downloading it and messing around for a few hours to see what you can do with it. I am also learning about creating an interactive document using R markdown, a flavor of Markdown that incorporates R for easy data visualization.
