title: Week 11 (02 Apr - 08 Apr, 2018)
---

**1. What did you do this past week?**

A lot of my time this past week was spent working on the SWE project. Our group started working really hard about 4 days before it was due, so it was a bit of a time crunch. I'm working on the backend of our website, so I worked on implementing filtering and sorting. In my elements of music class, we learned more about chords and different types of scales (the Dorian scale monks in the Middle Ages used is the same one many current pop songs are based on!). In Music of African Americans we talked about mid to late 90's east coast rappers. I highly recommend checking out [Nas's album Illmatic.](https://open.spotify.com/album/0cszZwl0JRKHBdcFLfNX3T) 

**2. What's in your way?**

Working on the SWE project can be difficult because we are mainly learning things on our own, rather that just what is taught in class. This makes things take more time, but it is also rewarding when you get it working.

**3. What will you do next week?**

I'm going to be working on schoolwork, and next weekend I'm going back home to Plano to visit my family.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

It's really informative, I like Professor Downing's teaching style when it comes to programming. Having examples of code up on the screen and showing how changes in the code affect the output in real time is very helpful. I've learned a lot about SQL in this class, which is really helpful for my data management class. Also the out of class experience might be the most helpful part of the class overall. Learning to work in a group to create something without strict guidelines is a great skill to learn while still in school, that will translate well to the real world.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

I've been working on an Android app, and an alternative to Java I've come across is [Kotlin.](https://kotlinlang.org/) It runs any Java code (like how C++ can run any C code) and seems to be more optimized for mobile development than Java. I haven't spent any time learning the language yet because I've been busy with other things and Java is suiting my needs fine for the app I'm making, but if you are interested in Android mobile development it could be something to check out!
