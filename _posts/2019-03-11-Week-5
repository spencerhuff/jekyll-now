title: Week 5 (5 Mar - 11 Mar, 2018)
---

**1. What did you do this past week?**

This past week was a lot of recovery from the previous week when I was bombarded with tests. I caught up on my work before spring break. I'm looking forward to having next week off to get refreshed before continuing and finishing out the semester strong.

**2. What's in your way?**

My own laziness! Sometimes it can be hard to force myself to work (especially if I'm not in the "mood" to work, which I'm not sure really even exists) but I am trying to work on it a little every day. I've seen some progress starting to show, and recently I have been finding myself focused more often than not.

**3. What will you do next week?**

Spring Break! I'm excited to have the next week off from school. My parents are taking my twelve year old sister and I to Disney World in Florida, which I am looking forward to.

**4. What's my experience of the class?**

I've liked it so far, the in class lectures have taught me more about Python and JavaScript than I would have ever been able to learn on my own in the same amount of time.

**5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

The best AR-hologram technology to date is being demoed by Sony right here in Austin this week for SXSW! It's still not perfect (and requires specific props to be used) but I'm looking forward to seeing where this technology is in 5 years.
