title: CS 373 Final Entry
---

**What did you like the least about the class?**
My least favorite part of the class was how what we learned in class didn't match up with what we needed to know for the project. Most of the things we learned for the project we learned on our own time (which is a valuable skill in and of itself).

**What did you like the most about the class?**
My favorite part of the class was learning about how to make a website from scratch. I feel like I learned a lot in this class and now understand a lot more about webdev in general.

**What's the most significant thing you learned?**
I worked mainly on the backend, so I think that the most signifigant thing that I learned was how to write components of and test an API. Now I know a lot more about how APIs work, and its interesting that sometimes when I go on websites now I notice parts of the URL that are making API calls (/search? etc.).

**How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?**
Maybe 20 hours every other week, since we usually waited to work on the projects until a week before they were due, so about 10 hours a week.

**How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?**
About 30 minutes a week.

**How many lines of code do you think you wrote?**
Probably about 1000, definitely a lot less than the members of my group that worked on the frontend.

**What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?**
PostgreSQL was one of the options we had for a database system, and I think it is very useful to know because it is one of the top options, along with MySQL, and is becoming more and moer popular.

**What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?**
TravisCI was a great way to automate unit testing, and it is very easy to use with GitHub.

**If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?**
I don't think that we should be required to use GitBook and GitPitch. Both are unintuitive and just don't work very well.
